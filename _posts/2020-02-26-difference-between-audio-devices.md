# Intro

I believe most of you all really likes to listen to music, whether because you love it or just to relieve yourself for a moment or paling games, etc. There are 2 types of people when they are listening to a music, the loud speaker person and the quiet headphone/earphone/headset person. But have you though of this, what are the difference between those devices? Well, i'm sure we all know what a *speaker* is, but what about those other three? Let me explain it to you.

## Headphone

*Headphone* according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones) are "a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears.", basically a headphone is an audio device that wraps around your head that have the sole purpose of emitting a sound with **no mic**. There are different kinds of headphones like open-back, closed-back, planar, etc. But we will discuss about that on later posts. Example of a headphone is [Audeze LCD-4](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/3013/1908/products/LCD-4_Updated_2019_4471x4471_2000x.jpg?v=1567639742).

## Headset

We will not see a lot of difference between a headphone and a headset, but there **is** a key difference between them. Yes, they have **a mic**. Basically headsets are called as they were because it is a **set** of a headphone and a mic, they are mainly used not just to listen but also to talk/communicate, this is why a lot of gaming brands are making headsets of their own with their own gimmicks like *7.1 surround sound* or something. But the thing is, a headset will not sound better than a headphone in the same class, this is because they have a mic on them and this will cause an interfence in the sound signal. So choose wisely between a headphone or a headset, example between a headset is [Sennheiser GAME ONE](https://assets.sennheiser.com/img/12865/product_detail_x2_desktop_GAME-ONE_thmbnl.jpg).

## Earphone

The last one is earphone, this is the easiest one to recognise and you will see this type more than the other two. Basically an earphone is a small of headphone of a pair of smaller small loudspeaker, that's it. So an earphone, instead of wraps around your head, they are plugged into both of your ears. This type is so popular because of their compact size and portability, so you can listen to your favorite songs anytime and anywhere you want. There are a lot of different kinds of earphones like IEMs, earbuds, handsfree, TWS, ect. Example on an earphone is [Ocharaku Flat4 Kaede III](http://ocharaku.jp/sound/wp-content/themes/soundcustomize/images/service/flat4-kaede3_p1.jpg).
